# Spring Boot in Openshift

This example is based in the hello world located in the [Spring website](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/), I just prepared to make it work in Openshift.

To work in local you can execute:
```
sh  mvn spring-boot:run 
```
It brings a convenient way to work in your local machine.
